## Scrollability Fix

### Issue:
Pages in the application (Dashboard, Reports, etc.) were not scrollable, preventing users from viewing content that extended beyond the viewport height. This affected the user experience across multiple pages.

### Root Cause:
1. The main layout container in `dashboard-layout.tsx` had restrictive height settings and was missing the necessary overflow properties to enable scrolling.
2. The CSS styling did not properly account for scrollable content in the main content area.
3. The `.scrollable` class was purely decorative and didn't actually enable scrolling functionality.
4. Fixed height containers were preventing content from expanding properly.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Layout Component Update (`dashboard-layout.tsx`):
- Changed `h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` to `min-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` to allow content expansion
- Added `w-full` to the content container to ensure proper width
- Maintained `overflow-y-auto` to keep vertical scrolling enabled
- Kept the sidebar navigation independently scrollable

#### 2. Global CSS Updates (`index.css`):
- Enhanced the `.scrollable` class to actually enable scrolling with `overflow-y-auto max-h-full`
- Added a new rule to ensure children of scrollable containers fill available width
- Added a `.scroll-shadow` utility class for subtle shadow indicators on scrollable content
- Maintained the subtle gradient overlay for visual scrolling indication

#### 3. Dashboard Page Updates (`dashboard-page.tsx`):
- Changed the main container to use `flex flex-col w-full` to ensure proper layout structure
- Added explicit width control with `w-full` on nested containers
- Added bottom padding (`pb-20`) to ensure sufficient space at the bottom
- Added mock content for testing scrollability
- Simplified the flex layout for better content flow

### Benefits:
- All pages now properly scroll when content exceeds the viewport height
- Content can expand to its natural size without being constrained by fixed heights
- Added visual indicators (subtle shadows and gradients) to show when content is scrollable
- The sidebar remains fixed while content scrolls, maintaining good navigation UX
- Page layout is more responsive, adapting to different content lengths

### Compatibility:
- These changes maintain compatibility with existing settings and preferences
- No modifications to the Settings page or settings-related functionality
- The solution works on both desktop and mobile viewports

### Future Considerations:
- Apply similar scrolling patterns to other components that might have fixed heights
- Consider adding scrollable tables for data-heavy sections
- Ensure all new pages follow this improved scrolling pattern

## Toast Notification Fix

### Issue:
Toast notifications were unclickable and could not be dismissed by users, creating a poor user experience and potentially blocking parts of the interface.

### Root Cause:
1. Toast component had insufficient z-index values to appear on top of other UI elements
2. Modal overlays and dialogs were capturing click events, preventing interaction with toasts
3. The dashboard layout applied `pointer-events-none` to the entire content area when showing the welcome checklist
4. The toast implementation didn't properly handle event propagation
5. The toast notification component had competing CSS rules affecting interactivity

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Toast Component Updates (`toast.tsx`):
- Increased the z-index from 200 to 500 to ensure toasts appear above all other elements
- Added `pointer-events-auto` explicitly to all interactive elements to ensure clicks are registered
- Added z-index to the close button to ensure it's always clickable (z-index: 501)
- Enhanced the Toast component with clearer interactive styling

#### 2. Toaster Component Enhancement (`toaster.tsx`):
- Added a wrapper div with `z-[999]` to ensure highest priority rendering
- Implemented clean event handlers with better separation of concerns
- Enhanced styling with `shadow-lg` and proper spacing
- Fixed event propagation and added explicit `preventDefault` to close button

#### 3. Dashboard Layout Fixes (`dashboard-layout.tsx`):
- Modified the blur effect to avoid `pointer-events-none` on the entire screen
- Applied pointer-events restrictions more selectively to the content area
- Preserved toast interactivity when modals are active

#### 4. App.tsx Updates:
- Added a test toast in development mode to verify functionality
- Added a z-index wrapper around the Toaster component
- Improved component organization for better rendering priorities

#### 5. Toast Hook Enhancements (`use-toast.ts`):
- Added enhanced props handling with sensible defaults
- Improved onOpenChange callback to properly maintain state
- Added convenience methods for common toast types (success, error, info, warning)
- Fixed duration handling for automatic dismissal

### Benefits:
- Toast notifications are now fully interactive and dismissible
- Users can click directly on toasts or use the close button to dismiss them
- Toasts properly display above all other UI elements, even when modals are active
- Improved visualization with better shadows and spacing
- Added convenient helper functions for creating different types of notifications

### Compatibility:
- These changes maintain compatibility with existing toast usage throughout the application
- No modifications were made to the Settings page or settings-related functionality
- The solution works on both desktop and mobile viewports

### Testing:
- Added a development-only test toast to verify functionality automatically
- Manually tested toast interactions with and without modals
- Verified proper behavior across different pages and states
