## Staff Check-In Functionality Update

### Overview
The staff check-in functionality has been fixed to enable proper check-in for event staff. This includes both self check-in (via the camera/selfie process) and manual check-in (via the staff list for organizers).

   - Fixed the "Manual Check-In" button functionality
   - Added loading state during check-in processing
   - Updated the UI to show check-in status more clearly
   - Added timestamp display for checked-in staff
   - Disabled check-in buttons for already checked-in staff

2. **CameraView Component**
   - Enhanced the selfie capture functionality
   - Improved visual feedback during face recognition

4. **StaffConfirmationPage**

### User Flow:
1. Staff can check in via selfie on their mobile device

3. A success confirmation is displayed with event details
4. The staff's status is updated in the system

### Organizer Flow:
1. Organizers can view staff check-in status on the staff list
2. They can manually check in staff if needed
3. Real-time status updates show which staff have checked in

### Notes:

- Success/failure notifications provide clear feedback to users
- The system handles error cases gracefully with appropriate messages
- The camera permissions are requested and handled properly
