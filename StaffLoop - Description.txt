# StaffLoop - Staff Check-In Feature Documentation

## Staff Check-In Functionality Update

### Overview
The staff check-in functionality has been fixed to enable proper check-in for event staff. This includes both self check-in (via the camera/selfie process) and manual check-in (via the staff list for organizers).

### Key Components Updated:

1. **StaffList Component**
   - Fixed the "Manual Check-In" button functionality
   - Added loading state during check-in processing
   - Updated the UI to show check-in status more clearly
   - Added timestamp display for checked-in staff
   - Disabled check-in buttons for already checked-in staff

2. **CameraView Component**
   - Enhanced the selfie capture functionality
   - Improved visual feedback during face recognition
   - Added better positioning instructions for staff
   - Fixed onCapture callback to properly trigger the check-in process

3. **StaffCheckinPage**
   - Added proper loading states for better user experience
   - Implemented mock API responses (for demo purposes)
   - Fixed geolocation handling with fallbacks
   - Added storage of check-in data for the confirmation page
   - Enhanced error handling with descriptive messages

4. **StaffConfirmationPage**
   - Added data retrieval from sessionStorage
   - Implemented fallback to user data when needed
   - Enhanced the page with a "Return to Dashboard" button
   - Improved the display of check-in confirmation information

### User Flow:
1. Staff can check in via selfie on their mobile device
2. The system verifies their identity
3. A success confirmation is displayed with event details
4. The staff's status is updated in the system

### Organizer Flow:
1. Organizers can view staff check-in status on the staff list
2. They can manually check in staff if needed
3. Real-time status updates show which staff have checked in

### Notes:
- The check-in timestamp is recorded and displayed in the UI
- Staff who have already checked in cannot check in again
- Success/failure notifications provide clear feedback to users
- The system handles error cases gracefully with appropriate messages
- The camera permissions are requested and handled properly 

## UI/UX Fixes

### Improved Spacing Between Header and Content
- Added increased padding (pt-24) between the header bar and main content area in the dashboard layout
- Fixed cramped spacing for the "Select an event to view statistics" dropdown on the Dashboard page
- Applied consistent spacing across all app tabs (Dashboard, Reports, etc.)
- Ensured content pages do not have redundant padding that would conflict with the layout spacing 

### Notification Bell Functionality
- Implemented dropdown menu for the notification bell in the navbar
- Added mock notifications with timestamp and read/unread status
- Implemented "Mark all as read" functionality
- Added visual indicators for unread notifications (blue background)
- Included notification counter badge that shows the number of unread notifications
- Ensured proper positioning and styling using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components
